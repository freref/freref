Here are some things I've worked on:

- [fzwatch](https://github.com/freref/fzwatch) lightweight and cross-platform file watcher
- [Tosi](https://github.com/tosichain/tosi) platform for issuing and verifying digital assets linked to real-world registries
- [rives-contracts](https://github.com/rives-io/rives-contracts/tree/devnet) smart contracts for RIVES, a RISC-V Verifiable Entertainment System
- [Cartesi Compute](https://github.com/cartesi/compute) verifiable computation platform using Linux VMs with RISC-V proofs
